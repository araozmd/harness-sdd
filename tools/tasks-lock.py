# tasks-lock.py — portable advisory lock for the harness board write path.
#
# Guards every persisted `state/tasks.json` mutation with a single advisory
# `fcntl.flock` on the sibling lockfile `state/tasks.json.lock` (resolved under
# HARNESS_DIR — see below), so concurrent writers (E15 parallel fix chains) can never
# lose an update (last-writer-wins clobber). The whole critical section runs in
# ONE process holding ONE lock:
#
#     acquire flock (bounded)  →  RE-READ state/tasks.json from disk  →
#     apply the single mutation  →  validate (JSON parse + schema)   →
#     atomic write (temp + os.replace)  →  release.
#
# Re-reading INSIDE the lock is the entire point: a second concurrent writer
# sees the first writer's committed result before applying its own mutation.
#
# Portability (R9): uses only the CPython stdlib `fcntl` (present on every POSIX
# platform the harness targets); it does NOT shell out to the Linux-only
# `flock(1)` binary, which is absent on the macOS dev platform.
#
# The `store.on_write_command` hook is intentionally NOT run here — the caller
# runs it AFTER this process returns (i.e. after the lock is released, R7).
#
# Usage:
#   tasks-lock.py set-status <id> <status> [--timeout SECONDS]
#       Set the status of the object <id> addresses (feature id `E06-F06` or
#       epic id `E06`) in state/tasks.json, under the lock.
#   tasks-lock.py apply --mutator <path> [--timeout SECONDS]
#       Run an external mutator on the freshly-read board (used for tests and
#       for callers that express a different single mutation). The mutator is a
#       python file exposing `mutate(data) -> data`.
#
# HARNESS_DIR (env) selects the board root; when unset it is derived from this
# helper's own path — the file lives at <HARNESS_DIR>/tools/tasks-lock.py, so the
# harness dir is the parent of the parent of __file__. Deriving from __file__ (not
# cwd) makes the documented invocation correct from ANY cwd, in BOTH the source
# layout (tools/tasks-lock.py, board at state/tasks.json) and the installed layout
# (.harness/tools/tasks-lock.py, board at .harness/state/tasks.json).
