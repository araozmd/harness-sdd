description: Run the Orchestrator loop on the next actionable task (init → route → delegate)
---

Act as the **Orchestrator** (`.harness/agents/orchestrator.md`), resolving all
relative paths against `.harness/`.

1. Run `.harness/init.sh`. If it exits non-zero, STOP and report.
2. Read `.harness/harness.config.yaml` and the TaskStore (per `.harness/store/local.md`).
3. Find the next actionable feature and route it by status per
   `.harness/docs/WORKFLOW.md`:
   - `pending` + sdd:true → spawn **architect**, then `spec-ready` and PAUSE (human gate).
   - `spec-ready` + autonomous:true → set `in-progress`, spawn **builder**, then `in-review`.
   - `in-progress` → spawn **builder** with the approved specs only, then `in-review`.
   - `in-review` → spawn **reviewer**; approve → `done`, reject → back to `in-progress`.
4. Append what happened to `.harness/progress/history.md`.

$ARGUMENTS may name a specific feature id (e.g. `E02-F01`); if given, operate on it.
